My attempt to read the book [
Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/) and solve the exercises using Jupyter notebook. I added mathematical explanations wherever I could.

Here are the main notebooks so far:

* `happiness.py`: Happiness quotient for different countries 
* `Housing.ipynb` : Housing price in California
* `logistic.py`: Understanding logistic regression
* `MNIST.ipynb`: Playing around with MNIST data
* `Models.ipynb`: Various models
* `Support Vector Machine.ipynb`: That one
* `lightdata.ipynb`: Optimum brightness of laptop screen based on ambient light and content of the screen
* `logistic-money.py`: Logistic regression on expenditure  
* `signal.ipynb`: Signal processing
* `ml-notes.tex`: My notes of machine learning
* `Untitled.ipynb`: 
* `datasets`: most of the datasets used here
